## Thema: From a Monolith to Microservices
We have a monolithic application that provides an overview over a collection of movies that we get from an opensource movie database. Users with a user account on this website are allowed to perform certain operations in connection to these movies. These operations include rating movies and managing a "watch list" and "watched list".
