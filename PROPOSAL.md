## Thema: From a Monolith to Microservices
We have a monolithic application that provides an overview over a collection of movies that we get from an opensource movie database. Users with a user account on this website are allowed to perform certain operations in connection to these movies. These operations include rating movies and managing a "watch list" and "watched list".
The goal is to restructure the monolith to multiple microservices, which will run on seperate containers. To demonstrate the functionality of the microservices, they will be deployed using Kubernetes.
